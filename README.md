# vmacpad

A custom macro pad especially suited for FCPX and any other thing that needs
scrolling!

## ToDos from an old project

- Improve plate manufacture or / and increase switch opening size. The current
dimensioning is ok but fairly tight.
- Do the same for the stabs, if possible add at least 1mm left / right for the
stems
